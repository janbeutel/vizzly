Vizzly is a Java Web application that enables the interactive browsing of very large sensor data sets by storing pre-aggregated values in a cache.

Features:

  * Interactive browsing of large data sets in time and space
  * JavaScript library for integrating powerful time series and map visualization widgets into arbitrary web pages
  * Supported data sources: CSV files (new!), [GSN servers](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gsn/)
  * Aggregated data is stored in memory and in a SQL database (optional)
  * Simple configuration based on an XML file (new!)
